# Background

DGMQ plays a key role in limiting the introduction, transmission, and spread of infectious diseases in the United States â€“ and conducting air contact investigations, or Air Cis, is a key part of that work. 

Exchanging traveler-related data between DGMQ and jurisdictional health departments, abbreviated as HDs in this IG, is critical to conducting Air CIs that result in meaningful public health outcomes.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that current ways of sharing information are not scalable, specifically related to Air Cis. 

As such, DGMQ and MITRE and MITRE are working together to explore the current state of data exchange, with specific focus on Air CI data, and develop recommendations for future improvements.
