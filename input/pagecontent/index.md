# Background

DGMQ plays a key role in limiting the introduction, transmission, and spread of infectious diseases in the United States â€“ and conducting air contact investigations, or Air Cis, is a key part of that work. 

Exchanging traveler-related data between DGMQ and jurisdictional health departments, abbreviated as HDs in this IG, is critical to conducting Air CIs that result in meaningful public health outcomes.

The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that current ways of sharing information are not scalable, specifically related to Air Cis. 

As such, DGMQ and MITRE and MITRE are working together to explore the current state of data exchange, with specific focus on Air CI data, and develop recommendations for future improvements. 

# Introduction and Purpose

The purpose of the Report of Ill Travelers Implementation guide is to develop a consensus-based standards solution to support The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Division of Global Migration Health (DGMH) in its role as the national coordinator of the contact tracing activities for air travel. Air Contact Investigations (ACIs) is the process of identifying and notifying passengers who may have come into contact with a person infected with a communicable disease during flight. These investigations provide information to US and foreign jurisdictions to mitigate transmission and translocation of communicable diseases. ACIs require data exchange between state, local, territorial health departments and CDC that is currently manual and unstandardized. The ability of public health authorities to quickly contact exposed passengers and advise them on post-exposure actions, such as testing or quarantining is critical to stopping the chain of disease transmission. This project intends to improve the efficacy of ACI and decrease the burden of data exchange for public health authorities, by standardizing the reporting of ill traveler events, and decease the processing times that impact timeliness.


# Stakeholders
This project intends to work with public health subject matter experts at state, tribal, and territorial, and local (STLT) public health agencies, public health associations, public health data systems vendors, and CDC technical and programmatic subject matter experts to identify the essential information needed to characterize infectious disease event of ill traveler and transmit this information to CDC's Enterprise Data Exchange. Our goal is to translate the requirements of this exchange into an FHIR implementation guide for STLT use.
